3 Gears
==================================================

#The project is the sample code to an article comparing [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org/),and [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/).   

###(I took out Rapha&euml;l here, since I don't care much about it.)
  
It shows a simple drawing, animation, and interaction example in each and then combines it all in a complex animation of gears.
